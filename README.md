# Project Report: Electrical Grid Stability Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to analyze and predict the stability of an electrical grid under Distributed Smart Grid Control (DSGC) using a simulated dataset. The dataset simulates a 4-node architecture, including one electricity producer and three consumers, with 10,000 instances and 12 attributes.

## Dataset Description
The dataset comprises various features related to power production/consumption, adaptation willingness, and adaptation time.

### Attributes
- `p[x]`: Power produced or consumed by each node (`p1` to `p4`).
- `g[x]`: Adaptation willingness of each node (`g1` to `g4`).
- `tau[x]`: Time for each node to adapt their production/consumption (`tau1` to `tau4`).

### Target Variables
- `stab`: Numerical value indicating grid stability (positive value indicates instability).
- `stabf`: Categorical version of `stab`, representing the stability status.

## Data Preprocessing
